# hChat

hChat is a decentralized messaging application built on a custom blockchain developed from scratch using JavaScript. The application utilizes JavaScript-based smart contracts to facilitate secure and private communication between users. This project demonstrates the potential of custom blockchain solutions for decentralized applications (dApps).

## Features

- **Custom Blockchain**: A lightweight blockchain developed entirely in JavaScript, tailored for messaging.
- **JavaScript Smart Contracts**: Implements smart contracts in JavaScript to automate and secure messaging interactions.
- **Decentralized Messaging**: Ensures messages are securely stored on a distributed ledger.
- **End-to-End Encryption**: Messages are encrypted to ensure privacy between users.
- **User Authentication**: Secure user login and identity verification using a user crendential database.
